as per user filter , we need to show data

=> let { mealType , cuisine , location , hcost , lcost , page, sort} =  request.body

mealType => whenever we click On mealType from home page

cuisine => here we can select multiple option for that we will use an array later

location => by that location restaurant will show

costForTwo(hcost , lcost) => we gonna use mongoose operator $gt and $lt

sort => we gonna use sort method here => asceding , disceding

$in => https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/in/

page => pagenation

 let { mealType , cuisine , location , hcost , lcost , page, sort} =  request.body

note: we need to use like this 

page = page ? page : 1
sort = sort ? sort : 1  // 1 => asceding , -1 => disceding

let payload = {}
const itemPerPage = 2 

let startIndex = itemPerPage * page - itemPerPage
               = 2 * 3 - 2
               = 4

let endIndex = itemPerPage * page 
             = 2 * 3
             = 6

// if page number given , same page number , else byDefault use page 1 


we gonna use directly why cause we have already has declare in let variable , we can't able 
to use there const cause we are gonna reuse that variable 

    let filter =  {}   //payload

      => this emty object will hold all condition user will apply to search the filter 
      => we will use find() method it is mongoDB method
      => find() => promise reslove => then , reject => catcch

   ==> this how need to check ===> "cuisine" : [1, 4]
      
  let itemPerPage = 2

     // 2 item should be displayed at one page

  let startIndex = itemPerPage * page - itemPerPage 
                 = 2 * 3 - 2 
                 = 4
 => here page => user have select page number

  let endIndex = itemPerPage * page   
               =  2 * 3
               =  6
              
   .then((response) =>  {
         let filteredResponse = response.slice(startIndex , endIndex)
   } )   

   // from where to start  = 



   // mealtype => first we need mealtype number by that we need to show mealtype to the user
   // example = breakfast has id=2 so we need to show as per that number
